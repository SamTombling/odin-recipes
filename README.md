# odin-recipes
First Odin Project project

The purpose of this project is to create a simple website using HTML to list links to various recipes.
It will allow me to practise various skills such as Basic HTML (headings, paragraphs, hyperlinks), as
well as allowing me to practise using git within the command line.
